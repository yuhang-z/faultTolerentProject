## ECSE422 final project

### Yuhang Zhang & Rintaro Nomura

#### Notes:
* Programming environment: python3.7 
* We consider it would clearer to save the output into txt.files rather than in the CLI.
  * The Section1.txt would save the result of "Meet a given reliability goal" after completion.
  * The Section2.txt would save the result of "Maximize reliability subject to a given cost constraint" after completion.
* The program takes usually over 5 mins to complete.

### Thanks for your time reviewing our project, and please stay safe!
