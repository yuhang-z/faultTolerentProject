# Fault Tolerant Computing Project
The program designs a communication network between N cities. Matrices of cost and the network connection reliabilities are given in matrix M and R respectively. 

Program takes a text file as input defining the parameters, in the follwing format: 

N # number of cities
N(N-1)/2 numbers # costs of inter-city connecting
N(N-1)/2 numbers # reliabilities of inter-city connections
